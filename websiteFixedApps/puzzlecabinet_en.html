          <h2>How can the app be used?</h2>
          <p>Use the app to catalogue your puzzle collection, marking puzzles as owned, wished for, or completed. You can also rate your puzzles, take notes, and even keep track of the number of pieces for each puzzle. On the main screen, you can search all text fields, including those only seen in the detail screen. Thus, if you mark something in the notes field, you can create a list that way.</p>
          <p><em>Regarding pictures:</em> You can link a photo of a puzzle to a website where it's located (the URL should contain the name of the picture and usually ends with .jpg or .png, etc.). The advantage is that you can use a photo of a puzzle without having to save it on your device, and this link also goes along with an export to CSV and possible later imports.</p> 
          <p>You can also save a picture of a puzzle on your device and use it as an image. The advantage is that you can use the photo even when you are not connected to the internet. Saving a photo of a puzzle on your device does not include it in a CSV export, which has the benefit of faster loading and no internet is required to display the image.</p>
          <p>You can take a local photo in the app or select it from your photo album. These photos are stored within the app and are not visible to other apps. You can delete these photos by editing the puzzle and changing the photo or by deleting the puzzle. Multiple images for the same puzzle are not supported at this time. A local photo takes precedence over a linked photo, so if both exist, the link is ignored.</p>

          <h2>Future</h2>
          <p>The app is still under development. Work is being done to add new features and improve the user experience. The app is currently only available for Android devices. An iOS version is in development.</p>
          <p>The app is free to download and use. There are advertisements, which hopefully will help to offset some costs, but there are no in-app purchases. I am currently using tooling (Sentry at this moment) that sends error messages and potential problems from the app, mainly stack traces etc., with no personal data.</p>
          <p>The app is created with a puzzle enthusiast for puzzle enthusiasts. Keep in mind this is so far a hobby project that I do alongside my regular work, unfortunately, it does carry some costs with it. (hosting website, Google developer account, Apple Developer Account, etc.)</p> 
          <p>For feedback and suggestions, please contact via <a href="mailto:fixedapps7@gmail.com">fixedapps7@gmail.com</a>. Especially positive reviews in the app store are greatly appreciated.</p>
          <p>Features in development:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>CSV file import.</li>
            <li>Possible other ways to exchange puzzles, for example, after replacing a phone/tablet.</li>
            <li>Option for rating puzzles, for example by the number of stars.</li>
            <li>Sorting and grouping by different fields (currently only by the number of pieces).</li>
            <li>Searching on non-text fields, such as wishlist, incomplete, not yet made, etc.</li>
            <li>Possible wishes and findings after publication.</li>
            <li>More languages.</li>
            <li>In principle, it's also possible to launch this app relatively quickly for Windows and/or Mac, but I have no plans for that yet. If there is a lot of interest, I am open to it.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><i>PS. The website is not the highest priority, but I had to make one to publish in the app store. It's not my hobby, so don't expect a super site, I wanted to keep it simple and focus on the Apps.</i></p>
